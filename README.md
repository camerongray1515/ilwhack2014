Smart Data Hack 2014
====================

LocEmotion was built at the Smart Data Hack 2014 (https://comp-soc.com/ilwhack/page/home).  It plots areas on a map
using SIMD data (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/SIMD) and colours them based on their score, green 
represents a better score, red represents a lower score.  It then plots tweets on the map using their geolocation
and performs sentiment analysys on the tweet to attempt to work out the emotion of the Tweet.  The idea was to see if
emotion in people's tweets is at all related to the SIMD score of the area that it was sent from.
